# Numpy_Exercise
NumPy is a computational library that helps in speeding up Vector Algebra operations that involve Vectors (Distance between points, Cosine Similarity) and Matrices. Specifically, it helps in constructing powerful n-dimensional arrays that works smoothly with distributed and GPU systems. It is a very handy library and extensively used in the domains of Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Other than Python, it can also be used in tandem with languages like C and Fortran. Being an Open Source Library under a liberal BSD license, it is developed and maintained publicly on GitHub.
